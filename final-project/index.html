    <h1 id="title"> Screaming For Getting Your Package</h1>
  <h2 id="name"> Created by Nuo</h2>
  <h3 id="welcometo">Welcome to <b>World During Lockdown in Shanghai</b>!  </h3>   
  <p id="inspiration"> Feel free to shout out your stress when waiting the movement of the package. <b>Sorry, the website is still under the construction. The parcel hasn't been able to move yet. But just shout out!!!</b> </p>
 <div> <p>Instructions:
      1.Choose the Origin of the Package with Your Mouse carefully
      Tips: The circle with deeper colors and bigger sizes symbolizes a city with higher COVID-19 cases. If you want to get your package quicker, you need to choose the origin carefully.
      2.Use Your Voice to play with your package on the way.  
      Tips: It's pretty dull when you have no choice but to wait. Just play with your package during the waiting.
      3.When the package is stuck due to the city with serious COVID cases, please scream!
      Tips: Please keep an eye on the box. If the package is stuck, the box will send the notice. Only your screaming can make it move again! 
      4.Finally, broadcast the video to celebrate the arrival of your package. Feel free to play it again!
      Tips: Hope you can get fun!
